# Yazi & Zoxide & Zsh
This plugin for [zsh](https://www.zsh.org) adds just one shortcut, but unfolds the magic of both [Zoxide](https://github.com/ajeetdsouza/zoxide) and [yazi](https://github.com/sxyazi/yazi/) ðŸ§™
Without arguments, `y` just opens yazi. If you supply an argument that is a directory, yazi is opened in that directory. But if you supply anything else as an argument, `zoxide` is called with the argument and `yazi` is opened there. This is the efficiency you always wanted.

# Installation
Install the zsh plugin using your favorite plugin manager.

# History
This is shamelessly/efficiently copied from [ranger-zoxide](https://github.com/fdw/ranger-zoxide), which was also just an interation of [ranger-autojump](https://github.com/fdw/ranger-autojump).
