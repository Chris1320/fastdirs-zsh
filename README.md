# fastdirs-zsh

This plugin for [zsh](https://www.zsh.org) adds just one shortcut, but unfolds
the magic of [wd](https://github.com/mfaerevaag/wd), [Zoxide](https://github.com/ajeetdsouza/zoxide),
and [yazi](https://github.com/sxyazi/yazi/) ðŸ§™

Without arguments, `y` just opens yazi. If you supply an argument that is a
directory, yazi is opened in that directory. If you supply a warp point,
yazi is opened in the location of that warp point. And if you supply
anything else as an argument, `zoxide` is called with the argument and
`yazi` is opened there.

_This is the efficiency you always wanted_.

## Requirements

This plugin is tested on the following software:

- [zsh](https://www.zsh.org) v*5.9*: The Z shell.
- [yazi](https://github.com/sxyazi/yazi) v*0.3.3*: Blazing fast terminal file manager.
- [Zoxide](https://github.com/ajeetdsouza/zoxide) v*0.9.6*: A smarter `cd` command.
- [wd](https://github.com/mfaerevaag/wd) v*0.9.1*: Jump to custom directories in zsh,
  without using `cd`.

## Installation

Install the zsh plugin manually or using your favorite plugin manager.

### Manual Installation

your `.zshrc`:

echo "source <path>/fastdirs.plugin.zsh" >> ~/.zshrc

exec zsh  # Restart your shell
```

### Using Oh-My-Zsh

```

Next, add `fastdirs` to the list of plugins in your `.zshrc`.

```

## History

This is shamelessly/efficiently copied from
[ranger-zoxide](https://github.com/fdw/ranger-zoxide), which was also just an
interation of [ranger-autojump](https://github.com/fdw/ranger-autojump).
